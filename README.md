## About Me

I'm an aspiring programmer who finds joy in the process of refining code, constantly on the quest for optimizing and enhancing the projects I engage with. My journey into the realm of programming began three years ago with Python and since then, I've expanded my skills to include a variety of programming languages such as C#, Lua, HTML, and CSS.

My main goal is to improve my understanding of programming through the meticulous task of refactoring code. I believe this process is not only an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills but also to provide a meaningful contribution to other developers. The core areas I'm aiming to refine include:

- Designing robust and efficient system structures
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Developing a strong ability to read and understand code written by others
- Documenting and commenting on code effectively
- Learning new programming concepts based on project requirements

Primarily, I use Python due to my extensive three-year experience with it. However, I'm also familiar and comfortable working with:

- C#
- Lua
- HTML
- CSS

## Technical Experience

In **Python**, I have experience working with a variety of libraries including **Flask**, **Arcade**, and **Pygame**. While my forte lies in developing console applications and modules, I also have experience in creating and managing web applications.

In **C#**, my journey of five months has been mainly filled with solving challenging **LeetCode problems** and creating some exciting console-based games. I continue to explore and push the boundaries of what I can achieve with this versatile language.

My **Lua** experience of three months, though brief, has been equally enriching. I've had the opportunity to develop simple games, testing and honing my understanding of the language and game development concepts.

Please note that while my exposure spans various languages and libraries, my main focus lies in developing console applications and prototyping smaller games.

## On Forked Repositories

If you're visiting my profile because I've forked and proposed a merge to your repository, I'd like to express my gratitude for taking the time to review my profile. I assure you, my intentions are purely educational and collaborative. I'm here to learn, refine my skills, and if possible, contribute positively to your project.

It is my belief that every piece of code, regardless of its current state, holds the potential for improvement and learning. Hence, my refactoring of your code is not a critique of your skills but rather an indication of my fascination with the project and the challenges it presents. 

If you consider my changes inappropriate, you're welcome to ignore them. However, I would appreciate it if you could provide constructive feedback on my proposals. Your insights will greatly aid my learning process.

Once again, thank you for your time and for providing the community with your valuable code!

## Professional Aspirations

As I continue to learn and grow, my ultimate goal is to utilize my skills in a professional setting. I'm constantly seeking opportunities that challenge me and push me to innovate. 

I view my forked repositories and projects as a part of my portfolio, a testament to my journey of continuous learning and growth. I look forward to opportunities where I can further prove my capabilities and contribute to meaningful, impactful projects.

Remember, my journey is all about improvement and learning, and your repository is a valued step on this path. Thank you for being a part of it!
