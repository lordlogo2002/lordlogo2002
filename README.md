## About me
- i like to refactor code
- i work with some languages:
    - python: 3 years
    - C#: 5 months
    - lua: 3 months

## Forked Repositorys
If you visit my profile, because i forked and requested a merge to your repository, then i must say thank you for investing time in researching my profile. I can promise you that i will not steal your project and that its only for learning purposes on my side. i want to better myself in reading your code. and refactor it. You can ignore it, if you don't consider my changed appropriate. But it would make me happy if you can review my merge request and give me constructive feedback and criticism. With that said I also want to acknowledge that I in no way, view you code as bad, ugly or noob like. I only see a interesting idea and challenge for me to work on.

## My Goals
My goal is to better my understanding of programing by refactoring code off other people. In this process I try to better my skills in:
- the creation off program/system structures
- writing clean code
- reading and understanding other code
- document and comment said code
- learn new concepts of programing based
  on the needs of an project

Also I mainly program in python since I used it  for over 3 years now. But besides that I work also with:
- C#
- Lua
- Html
- CSS

## Experience with Different Languages
In **Python*", I have experience working with **Flask**, **Arcade**, and **Pygame** libraries. However, my main **focus** has been **on** developing **console applications** and **modules**.

In **C#**, I have primarily worked on solving **LeetCode problems** and creating a few **console-based** games.

With **Lua*", I have created **simple games**, although they are not very engaging and tend to become boring quickly.

Please note that while I have explored various libraries and languages, my projects have been more **focused on console applications** and **smaller game prototypes**.
