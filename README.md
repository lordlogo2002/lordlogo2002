## Forked Repositorys
If you visit my profile, because i forked and requested a merge to your repository, then i must say thank you for investing time in researching my profile. I can promise you that i will not steal your project and that its only for learning purposes on my side. i want to better myself in reading your code. and refactor it. You can ignore it, if you don't consider my changed appropriate. But it would make me happy if you can review my merge request and give me constructive feedback and criticism. With that said I also want to acknowledge that I in no way, view you code as bad, ugly or noob like. I only see a interesting idea and challenge for me to work on.
